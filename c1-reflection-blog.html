  <h2>My reflections blog</h2>
  <p>So far my EDA experience has been great ive met some cool people and learnt alot of new stuff already I can see that if I need help it is there and avalible and though the work has been tough ive greatly enjoyed it. i think i will fit in greatly as i love working through issues till they are resolved and i love helping people and im less shy now so i might even ask for help myslef. My expectatons were exactly how the course has turned out so far though while i expected it to be like this it still suprised me. im very exited to work with everyone is such a friendly enviroment though i am a little nervous about speaking to people for the first time</p>
